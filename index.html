                    <h3>San Jose resident for 20 years</h3>
                    <p>San Jose has great weather year round and has lots to offer in terms of food, outdoor activities and events. 
                        It is within an hour drive from the large urban city of San Francisco, the coastal towns of Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay, and the Santa Cruz mountain range.
                        There are plenty of outdoor activities you can do in these areas in your free time that not many places can offer.
